      <p>
        FitTrack is a simple Fitness and Diet Tracking Web Application
        designed to help users log their daily workouts, record meals, and
        monitor their overall health progress. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is to help users maintain a healthy lifestyle by
        keeping track of their exercise routines and diet patterns, all in one
        convenient place.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project was created as a mini-project for our Web Technology course.
        It uses the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js)
        to create a full-stack, dynamic web application.
